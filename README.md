# Downloads

You can find downloads for Old Animations on either the [CurseForge page][curseforge] or through
the [GitHub Releases page][releases]. Usually, releases will be made on GitHub slightly sooner than
[CurseForge][curseforge].

## Versioning Strategy

The Old Animations Project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semantic_versioning] as their versioning strategy:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
  3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```

# Compiling

### Prerequisites

You will need to install [JDK][jdk] _(acronym for **J**ava **D**evelopment **K**it)_ <u>at least version 8</u> in order
to build the Old Animations Project. We highly recommend [AdoptOpenJDK][jdk] due to its performance and stability. You
can either install this over a package manager on Windows, Linux or macOS by following the installation guide for the
selected JDK distribution. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can grab the installers or packages
directly from the `Downloads` page.

Obviously, you also will need [Git][git] to clone our GitHub repository instead of cloning using the GitHub interface.

### Getting started

Navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository and build with Gradle using `./gradlew.bat build` on Windows or
`./gradlew build` if you are using macOS or a Linux distribution. The initial setup may take a few minutes. After Gradle
has finished preparing the environment for you and building everything, you can find the `.jar` artifact were is located
at `./build/libs` along the `*-dev.jar` artifact.
